              microglia are the main representatives of the innate immune
              system. Microglial fulfil tasks beyond phagocytosing debris and
              host defense against invading microorganism. During brain
              development microglia guide for example neurons for proper CNS
              formation, in adulthood they maintain tissue homeostasis and in
              aging microglia may become pro-inflammatory and finally
              exhausted. Recently, several endogenous and exogenous factors
              were identified that essentially shape the microglial phenotype
              during both steady-state and pathological conditions. On the one
              hand, microglia receive inputs from CNS-endogenous sources for
              example, via crosstalk with other glial cells and neurons but on
              the other hand microglia are also highly modulated by external
              signals. Among them, host microbiota-the host's resident
              bacteria-are vital regulators of the CNS innate immune system.
              This review summarizes key extrinsic and intrinsic factors, with
              special focus on the host microbiota, that essentially influence
              microglia functions and states during development, homeostasis,

              neural network that is under constant surveillance by

              Invading pathogens or sterile injuries might compromise vitally
              the CNS integrity and function. A prompt anti-inflammatory
              response is therefore essential to contain and repair the local
              tissue damage. Although the origin of the insults might be
              different, the principles of tissue backlashes, however, share
              striking similarities. CNS-resident cells, such as microglia and
              astrocytes, together with peripheral immune cells orchestrate an
              array of events that aim to functional restoration. If the acute
              inflammatory event remains unresolved, it becomes toxic leading
              to progressive CNS degeneration. Therefore, the cellular,

  abstract = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by $\beta$-amyloid
              plaques and intraneuronal $\tau$ aggregation usually associated
              with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Both $\beta$-amyloid
              plaques and CAA deposits contain fibrillar aggregates of the
              amyloid $\beta$-peptide (A$\beta$). A$\beta$ plaques and CAA
              develop first in neocortical areas of preclinical AD patients
              and, then, expand in a characteristic sequence into further brain
              regions with end-stage pathology in symptomatic AD patients.
              A$\beta$ aggregates are not restricted to amyloid plaques and
              CAA. Soluble and several types of insoluble non-plaque- and
              non-CAA-associated A$\beta$ aggregates have been described.
              Amyloid fibrils are products of a complex self-assembly process
              that involves different types of transient intermediates. Amongst
              these intermediate species are protofibrils and oligomers.
              Different variants of A$\beta$ peptides may result from
              alternative processing or from mutations that lead to rare forms
              of familial AD. These variants can exhibit different
              self-assembly and aggregation properties. In addition, several
              post-translational modifications of A$\beta$ have been described
              that result, for example, in the production of N-terminal
              truncated A$\beta$ with pyroglutamate modification at position 3
              (A$\beta$N3pE) or of A$\beta$ phosphorylated at serine 8
              (pSer8A$\beta$). Both A$\beta$N3pE and pSer8A$\beta$ show
              enhanced aggregation into oligomers and fibrils. However, the
              earliest detectable soluble and insoluble A$\beta$ aggregates in
              the human brain exhibit non-modified A$\beta$, whereas
              A$\beta$N3pE and pSer8A$\beta$ are detected in later stages. This
              finding indicates the existence of different biochemical stages
              of A$\beta$ aggregate maturation with pSer8A$\beta$ being related
              mainly to cases with symptomatic AD. The conversion from
              preclinical to symptomatic AD could thereby be related to
              combined effects of increased A$\beta$ concentration, maturation
              of aggregates and spread of deposits into additional brain
              regions. Thus, the inhibition of A$\beta$ aggregation and
              maturation before entering the symptomatic stage of the disease
              as indicated by the accumulation of pSer8A$\beta$ may represent
              an attractive treatment strategy for preventing disease

              this spread remains unclear. Here, we show an important role of
              intracellular A$\beta$ in its prion-like spread. We demonstrate
              that an intracellular source of A$\beta$ can induce amyloid
              plaques in vivo via hippocampal injection. We show that
              hippocampal injection of mouse AD brain homogenate not only
              induces plaques, but also damages interneurons and affects
              intracellular A$\beta$ levels in synaptically connected brain
              areas, paralleling cellular changes seen in AD. Furthermore, in a
              primary neuron AD model, exposure of picomolar amounts of
              brain-derived A$\beta$ leads to an apparent redistribution of
              A$\beta$ from soma to processes and dystrophic neurites. We also

              we propose a mechanism for how intracellular accumulation of
              A$\beta$ disturbs homeostatic control of A$\beta$ levels and can
              contribute to the up to 10,000-fold increase of A$\beta$ in the

              NSC 23766, worsened functional recovery, which was assessed by
              the pellet reaching test from day 14 to day 28 after stroke. It

  abstract = "The immune response to stroke is an exciting target for future
              stroke therapies. Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and
              mortality worldwide, and clot removal (mechanical or
              pharmacological) to achieve tissue reperfusion is the only
              therapy currently approved for patient use. Due to a short
              therapeutic window and incomplete effectiveness, however, many
              patients are left with infarcted tissue that stimulates
              inflammation. Although this is critical to promote repair, it can
              also damage surrounding healthy brain tissue. In addition, acute
              immunodepression and subsequent infections are common and are
              associated with worse patient outcomes. Thus, the acute immune
              response is a major focus of researchers attempting to identify
              ways to amplify its benefits and suppress its negative effects to
              improve short-term recovery of patients. Here we review what is
              known about this powerful process. This includes the role of
              brain resident cells such as microglia, peripherally activated
              cells such as macrophages and neutrophils, and activated
              endothelium. The role of systemic immune activation and
              subsequent immunodepression in the days after stroke is also
              discussed, as is the chronic immune responses and its effects on
              cognitive function. The biphasic role of inflammation, as well as
              complex timelines of cell production, differentiation, and
              trafficking, suggests that the relationship between the acute and
              chronic phases of stroke recovery is complex. Gaining a more
              complete understanding of this intricate process by which
              inflammation is initiated, propagated, and terminated may
              potentially lead to therapeutics that can treat a larger
              population of stroke patients than what is currently available.
              The immune response plays a critical role in patient recovery in
              both the acute and chronic phases after stroke. In patients, the
              immune response can be beneficial by promoting repair and
              recovery, and also detrimental by propagating a pro-inflammatory
              microenvironment. Thus, it is critical to understand the
              mechanisms of immune activation following stroke in order to
              successfully design therapeutics.",

              kinases family, regulated by ∼21 kDa small signaling G proteins

              (PAK1-6) that are classified into two groups (I and II) based on
              their domain architecture and regulatory mechanisms. PAKs are
              implicated in a wide range of cellular functions. PAK1 has
              recently attracted increasing attention owing to its involvement
              in oncogenesis, tumor progression, and metastasis as well as
              several life-limiting diseases and pathological conditions. In
              Caenorhabditis elegans, PAK1 functions limit the lifespan under
              basal conditions by inhibiting forkhead transcription factor
              DAF-16. Interestingly, PAK depletion extended longevity and
              attenuated the onset of age-related phenotypes in a
              premature-aging mouse model and delayed senescence in mammalian
              fibroblasts. These observations implicate PAKs as not only

              PAK1-targeting, could be a viable strategy for developing cancer
              therapies with relatively no side effects and promoting healthy

              definite in vitro systems to support the hypothesis that the
              vascular basement membrane may act as a scaffold of amyloid
              $\beta$-peptide carried by perivascular drainage flow and
              accelerate its amyloid fibril formation in vivo. We previously
              reported the critical roles of interfaces and agitation on the
              nucleation of amyloid fibrils at low concentrations of amyloid
              $\beta$-peptide monomers. Here, we reproduced the perivascular

              Fast flow beads as an inert stirrer in air-free wells rotated at
              1rpm. We then reproduced the basement membranes in the media of

              cerebral blood flow (CBF) are related to the progression of
              secondary injury, although clinical studies have shown that CBF
              monitoring cannot fully and accurately evaluate disease

              venous blood flow; however, as an outflow channel of the cerebral

              venous blood flow after TBI, the present study established TBI
              mouse models of different severities, observed changes in
              cerebral venous blood flow by laser speckle flow imaging, and
              recorded intracranial pressure (ICP) after brain injury to

              Behavioral and histopathological assessments were performed after

              common yet the mechanisms of post-stroke recovery are far from

              we herein examined the functional role of endothelial Rac1 in
              post-stroke recovery and angiogenesis. METHODS: Transient middle
              cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice and oxygen-glucose
              deprivation (OGD) in human brain endothelial cell line-5i (HEBC
              5i) were performed to mimic ischemic stroke. Lentivirus vectors
              encoding Rac1 with GFP and endothelial promotor ENG were injected
              into the animal's brain after stroke to overexpress Rac1. After
              injection, stroke recovery was tested by multiple behavioral
              tests including novel object recognition, adhesive removal and
              single pellet reaching tests. Endothelial regeneration in the
              peri-infarct zone was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In
              the vitro model, the effect of Rac1 and Pak1 inhibitors to cell
              proliferation and migration was examined by CCK-8 and wound
              healing assays after OGD. The cellular protein level of
              brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), phosphorylated cAMP
              response element-binding protein (CREB), extracellular
              signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and mitogen-activated protein
              kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 were detected by western blots. RESULTS:
              Delayed overexpression of endothelial Rac1 after MCAO improved
              cognitive and sensorimotor recovery from day 14 to 21 after
              stroke, increased vascular density and the protein level of
              pericytes in the peri-infarct zone without altering tissue loss
              in mice. Consistently, inhibition of Rac1 prevented endothelial
              proliferation and migration after OGD. Pak1 inhibition exerted a
              similar effect on endothelial cells. However, co-incubation of
              Rac1 and Pak1 inhibitors with cells did not lead to additive
              effects when compared with either inhibitor alone. Moreover,
              individual inhibition of Rac1 or Pak1 suppressed OGD-induced
              activation of pro-regenerative molecules, including CREB, MEK1/2
              and ERK1/2, as well as the production of BDNF in vitro. The level
              of these proteins did not further decrease if both Rac1 and Pak1
              were simultaneously inhibited. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that
              activation of endothelial Rac1 improves functional recovery and
              angiogenesis after stroke, and this process is mediated by Pak1
              signaling. This study provides novel insight for Rac1 in the
              mechanism of long-term stroke recovery.",

              these cells is their ability to differentiate into neurons within

              N2a cells do not provide information about the neuronal types
              obtained after each treatment. In this study, we evaluated the
              generation of N2a dopamine neurons following treatment with a
              number of factors known to induce neuronal differentiation. Our
              results showed that N2a cells express Nurr-related factor 1
              (Nurr1) and produce low levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and
              dopamine. Both TH and dopamine levels were significantly enhanced
              in the presence of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate
              (dbcAMP), as evidenced by Western blot, immunocytochemistry and
              high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In contrast to

              microglial behavior in vitro. Microglial cell lines serve as an
              attractive alternative to primary microglia culture,
              circumventing the costly and lengthy preparation of the latter.
              However, immortalization by genetic or pharmacologic
              manipulations may show altered physiology from primary microglia.
              NEW METHOD: A novel microglial cell line was isolated from a
              primary glial culture of postnatal murine cerebral cortices. The
              culture contained a population of spontaneously transformed
              microglia that continued to divide without genetic or
              pharmacological manipulations. After several clones were
              isolated, one particular clone, SIM-A9, was analyzed for its
              microglial characteristics. RESULTS: SIM-A9 cells expressed
              macrophage/microglia-specific proteins, CD68 and Iba1. SIM-A9
              cells were responsive to exogenous inflammatory stimulation with
              lipopolysaccharide and $\beta$-amyloid, triggering tyrosine
              kinase-based and NF$\kappa$B signaling cascades as well as
              TNF$\alpha$ secretion. SIM-A9 cells also exhibited phagocytic
              uptake of fluorescent labeled $\beta$-amyloid and bacterial
              bioparticles. Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide increased the
              levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2,
              whereas IL-4 stimulation increased arginase-1 levels
              demonstrating that SIM-A9 cells are capable of switching their
              profiles to pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes, respectively.
              COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The use of SIM-A9 cells avoids
              expensive and lengthy procedures required for the preparation of
              primary microglia. Spontaneously immortalized SIM-A9 cells are
              expected to behave more comparably to primary microglia than
              virally transformed or pharmacologically induced microglial cell
              lines. CONCLUSIONS: SIM-A9 cells exhibit key characteristics of
              cultured primary microglia and may serve as a valuable model
              system for the investigation of microglial behavior in vitro.",

              Here, we aimed to investigate whether alterations in astrocyte
              activity in AD are transient and depend on their
              microenvironment, or whether they are irreversible. We
              established and characterized a new protocol for the isolation of

              5xFAD mice have higher GFAP expression than astrocytes derived
              from WT mice, as observed in vivo. We found high C1q levels in
              brain sections from old 5xFAD mice in close vicinity to amyloid

              this progress it became obvious that those immune responses are
              tightly regulated and cross-linked with distinct metabolic
              changes in immune cells. Extensive research has been conducted
              mainly on subtypes of T cells, which use different metabolic
              pathways during differentiation processes and activation states.
              In addition, it has also been established later, that the innate
              immune cell lineage of myeloid cells includes a variety of
              different subsets of bone marrow-derived as well as
              tissue-specific macrophages, which elicit much more functions
              than simply killing bacteria. To execute this high variety of
              functions, also macrophages use different metabolic pathways and
              are tightly regulated by key metabolic regulators, such as the
              mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Upon activation,
              metabolic changes within the cell occur to meet the requirements

              However, PAK1 properties and functions have not been attributed

              Using fluorescently tagged forms of human PAK1-full,

              bind AhR directly as competitive antagonists, blocking AhR
              nuclear localization, XRE binding, and target gene induction
              mediated by AhR agonists like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin

              Rho family GTPases Rac and Cdc42. We previously reported that
              active PAK was markedly reduced in Alzheimer disease cytosol,
              accompanied by downstream loss of the spine actin-regulatory
              protein Drebrin. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) oligomer was implicated in
              PAK defects. Here we demonstrate that PAK is aberrantly activated
              and translocated from cytosol to membrane in Alzheimer disease
              brain and in 22-month-old Tg2576 transgenic mice with Alzheimer
              disease. This active PAK coimmunoprecipitated with the small
              GTPase Rac and both translocated to granules. Abeta42 oligomer
              treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons induced similar
              effects, accompanied by reduction of dendrites that were
              protected by kinase-active but not kinase-dead PAK. Abeta42
              oligomer treatment also significantly reduced N-methyl-d-aspartic
              acid receptor subunit NR2B phosphotyrosine labeling. The Src
              family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 significantly blocked the
              PAK/Rac translocation but not the loss of p-NR2B in Abeta42
              oligomer-treated neurons. Src family kinases are known to
              phosphorylate the Rac activator Tiam1, which has recently been
              shown to be Abeta-responsive. In addition, anti-oligomer curcumin
              comparatively suppressed PAK translocation in aged Tg2576
              transgenic mice with Alzheimer amyloid pathology and in Abeta42
              oligomer-treated cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results

  abstract = "CONTEXT: CD4 + CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes are critical
              for immune homeostasis. Foxp3 (Forkhead Box protein P3) is always
              considered as a marker of function and identities determination
              of Treg cells because of special occurring in Treg cell. People
              who lack Treg cells or have a low expression of Foxp3 gene will
              suffer fatal autoimmunity. Scientists are trying to use Treg
              cells as a treatment for autoimmune disease, such as systemic
              lupus erythematosus. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to induce Foxp3
              + CD4+ T cells from na{\"\i}ve CD4 + T cells isolated from C57
              mice spleen in vitro using stimuli that include the short chain
              fatty acid sodium butyrate. Furthermore, to explore the
              relationship between Foxp3+ T cells induction and epigenetic
              modification, by observing the changes of Foxp3, Ezh2 (Enhancer
              of Zeste Homolog 2) and phosphorylated Ezh2 in the induced Treg
              cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The na{\"\i}ve CD4+ T cells were
              separated from C57 mice spleen by immunomagnetic separation.
              Anti-CD28, anti-CD3, IL-2, TGF-$\beta$1, and sodium butyrate were
              added with proper concentration to induce Foxp3 expression during
              72 hours. Then, we observed the effect of GSK126 (Ezh2 inhibitor)
              on the induction within the same over 72 hours duration. Then,
              western blot and Q-PCR were used to see the changes in
              gene/protein expression of Foxp3, Ezh2, and phosphorylated Ezh2.
              RESULTS: According to our results, group 3 that received full
              stimulus had a significant higher level of Foxp3 and Ezh2
              expression (p < .05, comparing with group 1,2) and adding 5 mM
              sodium butyrate to the full stimulus (group 5) increased
              significantly the induction of Foxp3 and Ezh2 than control group
              and higher concentration group (p < .05, comparing with group
              3,4, 6). The gene and protein expression of Foxp3 and Ezh2 both
              were enhanced in group 5 (p < .05 comparing with group 3).
              However, phosphorylated Ezh2 decreased in group 5 (p < .05
              comparing with group3). Sodium butyrate removed part inhibition
              of GSK126, result in Foxp3 and Ezh2 expression (p < .05, p < .01,
              comparing with group7). CONCLUSION: In this study, we were able
              to transform CD4 + T cells into CD4 + Foxp3 + T cell by using
              stimulus like antibodies (anti-CD28, anti-CD3) and cytokines
              (IL-2, TGF-$\beta$1). Sodium butyrate contributes to CD4 + Foxp3
              + T cell induction in vitro and at an optimum concentration of 5
              mM. Sodium butyrate promotes expression of Ezh2 and Fxop3 of T

               (mPGES-1)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces angiogenesis through

               regulatory T cells (Tregs), which inhibit immune responses, have
               been implicated in angiogenesis, and PGE2 is known to modulate
               function and differentiation of Tregs. We hypothesized that
               mPGES-1/PGE2-EP signaling could contribute to recovery from
               ischemic conditions by promoting the accumulation of Tregs.
               METHODS AND RESULTS: Wild-type (WT), mPGES-1-deficient
               (mPges-1-/-), and EP4 receptor-deficient (Ep4-/-) male mice 6-8
               weeks old were used. Hindlimb ischemia was induced by femoral
               artery ligation. Recovery from ischemia was suppressed in
               mPges-1-/- mice and compared with WT mice. The number of
               accumulated forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3)+ cells in ischemic
               muscle tissue was decreased in mPges-1-/- mice compared with

               factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) and stromal cell derived factor-1
               (SDF-1) in ischemic tissue were also suppressed in mPges-1-/-
               mice. The number of accumulated FoxP3+ cells and blood flow
               recovery were suppressed when Tregs were depleted by injecting
               antibody against folate receptor 4 (FR4) in WT mice but not in
               mPges-1-/- mice. Recovery from ischemia was significantly
               suppressed in Ep4-/- mice compared with WT mice. Furthermore,
               mRNA levels of Foxp3 and Tgf-$\beta$ were suppressed in Ep4-/-
               mice. Moreover, the numbers of accumulated FoxP3+ cells in
               ischemic tissue were diminished in Ep4-/- mice compared with
               Ep4+/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggested that
               mPGES-1/PGE2 induced neovascularization from ischemia via EP4 by
               promoting accumulation of Tregs. Highly selective EP4 agonists
               could be useful for treatment of peripheral artery disease

               disease have no other option for treatments other than
               amputation. In the present study, we revealed that endogenous
               mPGES-1/PGE2-EP4 signaling induced recovery from ischemia by
               promoting Tregs accumulation at the ischemic site. In addition,
               we showed that selective EP4 agonist, or transplantation of
               Tregs, induced recovery from ischemic conditions. These results
               indicate that the use of selective EP4 agonist, or cell therapy
               of Tregs, may be a potential treatment option for severe

              may be involved in AD and CAA vascular pathogenesis in the
              context of aging. Brain endothelial cells were isolated from
              young and old wild-type mice, and young and old transgenic mice
              expressing Swedish mutation in amyloid precursor protein and exon
              9 deletion in presenilin 1 (APPswe/PSEN1dE9). Microarray
              profiling of these endothelial transcriptomes demonstrated that
              accumulation of vascular A$\beta$ in the aging APPswe/PSEN1dE9
              mouse is associated with impaired endothelial expression of
              neurotransmitter receptors and calcium signaling transductors,
              while the genes involved in cell cycle and inflammation were
              upregulated. These results suggest that the vascular pathology of
              AD and CAA may involve the disruption of neurovascular coupling,
              reactivation of cell cycle in quiescent endothelial cells, and
              enhanced inflammation. Further dissection of these endothelial
              mechanisms may offer opportunities to pursue therapies to

              both tissue and systemic homeostasis. This leads to a natural
              definition of inflammation as a response to deviations from

              extrinsic factors. Two of the most important factors affecting
              the immune response are biological sex and aging. Ischemic stroke
              is a debilitating disease that predominately affects older
              individuals. Epidemiological studies have shown that older women
              have poorer functional outcomes compared with men, in part due to
              the older age at which they experience their first stroke and the
              increased comorbidities seen with aging. The immune response also
              differs in men and women, which could lead to altered
              inflammatory events that contribute to sex differences in
              poststroke recovery. Intrinsic factors including host genetics
              and chromosomal sex play a crucial role both in shaping the host
              immune system and in the neuroimmune response to brain injury.

              innate immune cells invade brain and meninges and contribute to
              ischemic damage, but may also be protective. At the same time,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The brain's initial innate response to stroke is
              primarily mediated by microglia, the resident macrophage of the
              CNS. However, as early as 4 h after stroke, the blood-brain
              barrier is compromised and monocyte infiltration occurs. The lack
              of discriminating markers between these two myeloid populations
              has led many studies to generate conclusions based on the
              grouping of these two populations. A growing body of evidence now
              supports the distinct roles played by microglia and monocytes in
              many disease models. METHODS: Using a flow cytometry approach,
              combined with ex-vivo functional assays, we were able to
              distinguish microglia from monocytes using the relative
              expression of CD45 and assess the function of each cell type
              following stroke over the course of 7 days. RESULTS: We found
              that at 72 h after a 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion
              (MCAO), microglia populations decrease whereas monocytes
              significantly increase in the stroke brain compared to sham.
              After stroke, BRDU incorporation into monocytes in the bone
              marrow increased. After recruitment to the ischemic brain, these
              monocytes accounted for nearly all BRDU-positive macrophages.
              Inflammatory activity peaked at 72 h. Microglia produced
              relatively higher reactive oxygen species and TNF, whereas
              monocytes were the predominant IL-1$\beta$ producer. Although
              microglia showed enhanced phagocytic activity after stroke,
              monocytes had significantly higher phagocytic capacity at 72 h.
              Interestingly, we found a positive correlation between TNF
              expression levels and phagocytic activity of microglia after
              stroke. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the resident microglia
              population is vulnerable to the effects of severe ischemia, show
              compromised cell cycle progression, and adopt a largely
              pro-inflammatory phenotype after stroke. Infiltrating monocytes
              are primarily involved with early debris clearance of dying
              cells. These findings suggest that the early wave of infiltrating
              monocytes may be beneficial to stroke repair and future therapies
              aimed at mitigating microglia cell death may prove more effective
              than attempting to elicit targeted anti-inflammatory responses

              phenotyping is an important technique for examining age-related
              neuroinflammation. The most commonly used surface markers for the
              identification of microglia include CD45 (low-intermediate
              expression), CD11b, Tmem119, and P2RY12. METHODS: In this study,
              we examined changes in expression levels of these putative
              microglia markers in in vivo animal models of stroke, cerebral
              amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and aging as well as in an ex vivo
              LPS-induced inflammation model. RESULTS: We demonstrate that
              Tmem119 and P2RY12 expression is evident within both CD45int and
              CD45high myeloid populations in models of stroke, CAA, and aging.
              Interestingly, LPS stimulation of FACS-sorted adult microglia
              suggested that these brain-resident myeloid cells can upregulate
              CD45 and downregulate Tmem119 and P2RY12, making them
              indistinguishable from peripherally derived myeloid populations.
              Importantly, our findings show that these changes in the
              molecular signatures of microglia can occur without a
              contribution from the other brain-resident or peripherally

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The gut microbiota is associated with diverse
              age-related disorders. Several rejuvenation methods, such as
              probiotic administration and faecal microbiota transplantation,
              have been applied to alter the gut microbiome and promote healthy
              ageing. Nevertheless, prolongation of the health span of aged
              mice by remodelling the gut microbiome remains challenging.
              RESULTS: Here, we report the changes in gut microbial communities
              and their functions in mouse models during ageing and three
              rejuvenation procedures including co-housing, serum-injection and
              parabiosis. Our results showed that the compositional structure
              and gene abundance of the intestinal microbiota changed
              dynamically during the ageing process. Through the three
              rejuvenation procedures, we observed that the microbial community
              and intestinal immunity of aged mice were comparable to those of
              young mice. The results of metagenomic data analysis underscore
              the importance of the high abundance of Akkermansia and the
              butyrate biosynthesis pathway in the rejuvenated mouse group.
              Furthermore, oral administration of Akkermansia sufficiently
              ameliorated the senescence-related phenotype in the intestinal
              systems in aged mice and extended the health span, as evidenced
              by the frailty index and restoration of muscle atrophy.
              CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the changes in key microbial
              communities and their functions during ageing and three
              rejuvenation procedures, and the increase in the healthy lifespan
              of aged mice by oral administration of Akkermansia. Our results

              leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which is highly expressed

              (KO) RAW264.7 macrophage cells. Results showed that Mn activated
              LRRK2 kinase by phosphorylation of its serine residue at the 1292
              position (S1292) as a marker of its kinase activity in macrophage

              the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) protein. LRRK2

              inhibition of MAPK p38 and ERK as well as LRRK2 attenuated
              Mn-induced oxidative stress and cytotoxicity. These findings
              suggest that LRRK2 kinase activity plays a critical role in
              Mn-induced toxicity via downstream activation of MAPK signaling

              life of patients and caregivers. Despite the fact that sleep

              are available regarding interactions of sleep disturbances and
              cognitive performance. Objective: This post hoc analysis of the
              RaSPar trial was therefore designed to further elucidate sleep
              disturbances and their impact on cognition in PD. Methods:
              Twenty-six PD patients with sleep disturbances were evaluated
              thoroughly including assessments of patients' subjective and
              objective sleep quality by interview, questionnaires, and
              polysomnography (PSG). Cognitive performance was assessed by
              Parkinson Neuropsychometric Dementia Assessment (PANDA) and Test
              of Attentional Performance (TAP), and associations of sleep and
              cognitive function were evaluated. Results: We did not detect
              differences in cognitive performance between patients with and
              without rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD).
              Instead, cognitive impairment, particularly affecting cognitive
              domains attention, executive function/working memory, and
              semantic memory, was associated with impaired PSG-measured sleep
              quality (e.g., sleep efficiency) and sleep disordered breathing
              (SDB) (Apnea-Hypopnea Index > 5/h). Global cognitive performance
              was decreased in patients with SDB (PANDA score 23.2 $\pm$ 3.5
              vs. 26.9 $\pm$ 2.2, P = 0.020, unpaired two-sided t-test).
              Conclusion: Sleep apnea and other sleep disturbances impair
              cognitive performance in PD and should be evaluated in routine

              immunohistochemical assessment against microtubule-associated
              proteins 1A/1B light-chain 3B (LC3B). Intracellular A$\beta$42
              levels were significantly reduced by GAA treatment in microglial
              cells. Additionally, GAA activated autophagy according to
              increased LC3B-II levels, with this increased autophagy
              stimulated by upregulating Axl and Pak1 phosphorylation. The
              effect of eliminating A$\beta$ by GAA through autophagy was
              reversed by R428, an Axl inhibitor, or IPA-3, a Pak1 inhibitor.
              Consistent with the cell-based assay, GAA ameliorated cognitive
              deficiency and reduced A$\beta$42 levels in an AD mouse model.
              Furthermore, LC3B expression in the hippocampus was up-regulated
              by GAA treatment, with these GAA-specific effects abolished by
              R428. GAA promoted A$\beta$ clearance by enhancing autophagy via
              the Axl/Pak1 signaling pathway in microglial cells and
              ameliorated cognitive deficiency in an AD mouse model.",

  abstract = "The object recognition test (ORT) is a commonly used behavioral
              assay for the investigation of various aspects of learning and
              memory in mice. The ORT is fairly simple and can be completed
              over 3 days: habituation day, training day, and testing day.
              During training, the mouse is allowed to explore 2 identical
              objects. On test day, one of the training objects is replaced
              with a novel object. Because mice have an innate preference for
              novelty, if the mouse recognizes the familiar object, it will
              spend most of its time at the novel object. Due to this innate
              preference, there is no need for positive or negative
              reinforcement or long training schedules. Additionally, the ORT
              can also be modified for numerous applications. The retention
              interval can be shortened to examine short-term memory, or
              lengthened to probe long-term memory. Pharmacological
              intervention can be used at various times prior to training,
              after training, or prior to recall to investigate different
              phases of learning (i.e., acquisition, early or late
              consolidation, or recall). Overall, the ORT is a relatively
              low-stress, efficient test for memory in mice, and is appropriate
              for the detection of neuropsychological changes following
              pharmacological, biological, or genetic manipulations.",

              we show that histone deacetylase inhibitors (DAIs) that alter the
              acetylation of histones in chromatin enhance the expression of
              several genes on tumor cells including: MHC class I, II, and the
              costimulatory molecule CD40. Enhanced transcription results in a
              significant increase in protein expression on the tumor cell
              surface, and expression can be elicited on some tumors that are
              unresponsive to IFN-gamma. The magnitude of induction of these
              genes cannot be explained by the effect of DAIs on the cell cycle
              or enhanced apoptosis. Induction of class II genes by DAIs was
              accompanied by activation of a repressed class II transactivator
              gene in a plasma cell tumor but, in several other tumor cell
              lines, class II was induced in the apparent absence of class II
              transactivator transcripts. These findings also suggest that the
              abnormalities observed in some tumors in the expression of genes
              critical to tumor immunity may result from epigenetic alterations
